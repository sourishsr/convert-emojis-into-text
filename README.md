To convert emojis into text in Python, you can use the emoji library, which allows you to easily translate emojis to descriptive text.

emoji.demojize(text): This function takes a string with emojis and converts each emoji into a corresponding text label (e.g., üêç becomes :snake:).
The result will be a string where each emoji is replaced by text inside colons, like :snake: and :computer:.

This code will replace all emojis in a string with text descriptions, making it easier to read and process without graphical emojis.
